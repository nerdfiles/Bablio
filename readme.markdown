Oy vey, the Structure of this Text (Chapter 0)

On this day, writers shall be expected to carry with them a journal.

Such a technological normatization of culture imposes a structuring of the natural strictures which express themselves through the immanent capitalistic gradations of reality of epistemic priority. -- Oh? It's not that kind of book?

Think about it. What kind of .requirements _could_ a futurist author require? Or a anarchist leaflet designer, conscripted to author text? In some cases, one may author a text with no boundary, no margin, gutter, fold... What should be make of it when these normative strictures of thought, expressed as physical phenomena, approach their own resolve? _In time_, the behaviorists theoretical framework faded. As if the sentence whose falsity implies statements regarding the behavior of its language, this sentence informs us of a proximity to a thought, and all the way down through, throughout a framework thorough-going enough to produce its demise; that, chiefly, a language must needs such a characterization at all, to count as a language.

Every fright and thing fought in language compels one to build a trap, and every trap may be indiscriminate in its efficiency. Clearly, sweetly even, is so stated the premise of capitalism. The building of a thing at all is the thing of all that builds, from within itself, or that should its building build what is built before. Timely considerations dismay, and ignoring amounts to a commitment, expressed directly through the objective qualities of those commitments ontic manifestations. What can be ignored, as yet what is expressed? A .gitignore in this poem, or that essay. And who ever needs a download to construct the ruminations of their pens?

"All great artists, or designers, or so forth, are the masters of secrecy, sorcery, or so." -- We've heard this before. This is a readme.markdown document. It describes, or at least feigns that much, to that which does not, namely, this book, who in itself, feeling as quaintly and sorrowfully as I, its author, which must be written. It may touch on a number of topics, as it is an experiment, principle, hypothesis, and decision. I burrow, carelessly, in Alain Badiou's conceptual framework, and borrow fine the phenomonological flailing of Albert Camus. A tired Spinozist has little else, indeed in the letters of Americans. Grant me, surely, that you might tolerate a colored anarchist whose heroes are Steven Wright, Eddie Izzard, and David Spade.

One day, even the audience, shall see the madness of authors: when we expect repositories for the production of their words.
